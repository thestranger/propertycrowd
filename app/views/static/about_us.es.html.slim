/          | At UrbanKIT [

/          | ], we are *obsessed* with transforming peoples’ ideas for the city into reality. UrbanKIT is a people-friendly crowd-funding platform where individuals and communities can pitch ideas and win funding for neighborhood improvements [we love community gardens, parklets, play structures, bike security, sidewalk public services, and murals].
/        p More than 50% of the world population today lives in city, and by the year 2050, it is expected that 70% of world population does. Today, under-utilized and under-imagined urban spaces [freeway underpasses, vacant lots, walls, sidewalks, parking spots] are an untapped canvas for citizen creativity.
/        p Placemaking projects are inherently in public, community-accessible, civic spaces calling for essential hyper-localized ingredients like permits, design, public participation and community buy-in to be successful. On the one hand, city governments are not built for outreach to design and artistic communities and have limited funding and staffing to implement projects. On the other hand, people often express their creative side in sub-optimal ways for the city (e.g. graffiti) and have trouble accessing funding and understanding bureaucratic permitting processes. UrbanKIT aims to connect local government resources and global crowd-sourced funding with the creativity of citizen placemakers by providing a tool for civic engagement.
/        p By enabling citizens to select, support and share stories about city projects they love, UrbanKIT brings humanity back into the way we are building cities. We want to mainstream citizen urbanism and bring crowdfunding to new places and people. We seek to establish crowdfunding as a tool for building a city not just for everyday citizens but for decision makers and planners. By taking a small commission only on successfully funded projects, our success is tied to material neighborhood transformations for committed and engaged citizens.
